    intro_text: Paris P2P festival is over...<br/>for now!
    testimonial: "<p>Weâ€™re more certain than ever that it is important to enable P2P gatherings that are free (meaning both 'free speech' and 'free beer'), open to anyone's participation, and covering technical topics as well as political, social and cultural aspects.</p><p>That's why we set up the festival as an indie event: non-commercial, non-profit, with no sponsors or logos.</p><p>It has been made possible thanks to all the people supporting us, speakers and workshop moderators, and Ground Control - and also because of ourselves, organizers within the Osmose collective, as we funded and worked as volunteers to make the festival happen.</p><p>If you need to use another method or currency, please let us know.</p>
    <p>The accounts of the festival will be published shortly. Donations will be used to cover the expenses for the current festival or for the future events. If you have any questions, email us at <a href='mailto:festival@p2p.paris'>festival@p2p.paris</a>.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>A million thanks for your contribution!</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The Paris P2P festival crew.</p><br/>"
